Translations are a separate module. By activating it you have access to a series of screens allowing you to manage your translation requests.

See: :ref:`Module management<module-management>`


Translation request

You must enable configuration management to manage products, product versions, and release components.

When you request a translation, the fields "version component" and "product version" are mandatory.
